This repository is related to this [blog post](https://vincentle1.netlify.com/post/violent-video-games-a-simple-data-analysis/). 

- In the *create_final_data* file you will find
all of the functions and most of the data cleaning I did.

- In the *analysis* data file, you will find the code for the regression, correlation and plots I made. 
There is also bonus code where I checked assumptions for the regression. I did not mention this part in the blog post.

- Finally, the *violent_crime_FBI.xls* file is the data table I used to gather violent crime data from the FBI website.
